A demo for the impatients [is available here](https://bdavidxyz.github.io/simplest-startup-starter/).

If you are working in a startup, you will probably need a landing page for a marketing campaign under heavy time & budget contraints. 

This means :

- avoid spend time on programming,
- avoid spend time on design,
- avoid spend time on graphics (logo, favicon, hero image, etc),
- avoid spend time on server configuration,
- avoid spend recurring money (unbounce, strikingly, etc) for an idea you don’t even know it’ll work or not.


IMHO, the best starting point for a landing page, is :

- an extremely well crafted copywriting,
- a deployment solution to get your landing page visible to the world,
- a robust deployment solution to support strong traffic,
- a template that loads insanely fast,
- a template that works insanely well on mobile devices,
- a mean to chat directly with your customer,
- a mean to collect email from your customer,
- a way to track visit on your website,
- a mean to “make them pay".

**Don’t spend more than 1–2 days on it.** A very long but interesting explanation is [here](https://medium.com/@cliffordoravec/the-no-bs-approach-to-building-your-saas-startups-launch-list-part-2-of-the-epic-guide-to-8cc371be772c#.4f0ptjli9).

The only thing that should cost you time and energy is copywriting.

Anything else should be free - and actually is, with very low technical skills.

Here is what I recommend :

1. If you don’t agree with bullets points above, I suggest you again the reading of this ["epic guide"](https://medium.com/@cliffordoravec/the-no-bs-approach-to-building-your-saas-startups-launch-list-part-2-of-the-epic-guide-to-8cc371be772c#.4f0ptjli9) which largely motivated this simple template.
2. Write content inside a Google Doc, you should always [start design with content](http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/).
3. Subscribe to [Crisp.Im](https://crisp.im), [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), [Payfacile](payfacile.com), [Formspree](https://formspree.io/).
4. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bdavidxyz/simplest-startup-starter) of the raw template and follow instructions.
5. Deploy this raw Template to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
6. (optional) if you want a custom domain, you can buy it at namecheap.com - the only paying stuff of the tutorial, you can get a decent domain for less than 1$ a year.
