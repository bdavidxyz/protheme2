<p style="background-color:#f25454;color:white;">I currently accept new projects</p>

I'm a web developer based in Paris, France. I graduated a master in computer sciences, started my career as a back-end developer, have held various position as tester, quality leader, project leader, mentor, always keeping hands on code. I switched to front-end technologies years ago and now I am focused full-time on what I love doing: building great software.

Some things I look for in the things I work on:

- bring maximum value to the end user
- maximise empathy and mutual understanding
- robustness and stability
- have great design and user experience
- minimize efforts by automating everything I can

## Recent projects

**[Pix](https://pix.beta.gouv.fr)** : My last project (ended mid-2017). Pix is an [open source project](https://github.com/sgmap/pix), initiated by the French ministry of education. This is probably my greatest project so far. We have reached a crazy level of quality, productivity, with a great, warm and professional atmosphere. I wish all my future projects look like this one. (**EmberJS**, **NodeJS**, **SinonJS**, **SASS**, **ES6**)

**[Edge-Factory](https://www.edge-factory.com/)** : I worked as a contractor for Edge-Factory, a startup that aims to provide an analytical and management tool for leaders of mid-size companies. I built the front-part of the MVP, which was really tricky due to the heavy graphism requirements. (**React.js**, **Redux**, **Inuit.scss**, **SketchApp**, **Node.js**, **SVG**)

**[Livementor](https://www.livementor.com/)** : Livementor allows online tuition and tutoring. I worked there 6 month working on all aspect of the software, from database to responsive design.  (**Ruby on Rails**, **SASS**, **PostGreSQL**)

**[France TV](http://www.francetv.fr/)** : Auditing French television is one of the thing I'm the most proud of, professionnally speaking. I audited & created recommendations for their application that feed the news for journalists. (**AngularJS**)

**[Impatient-Jekyll](http://bdavidxyz.github.io/impatient-jekyll/)** : One of my open-source project : The ability to have a fully automated front-end workflow while keeping a decent tool to built any static website was badly missing to me.(**Web performance**, **SASS**, **Javascript**, **JekyllRB**, **Node.js**)

## Random stuff I enjoy

**A good chat**: There's nothing like an interesting chat over a fresh beer (maybe a couple), talking about startup, programming, cooking, cats, anything really. If you're in town and want to meet up, be sure to holler!

**Cooking**: Don't ask me why, but I love to cook. I try new recipes as much as I can, taking note on what failed and what can be done the next time to improve the recipe.

**Sport**: Just any, as long as I'm exhausted after practicing it.
