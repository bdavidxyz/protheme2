I'm a web developer based in Paris, France. I graduated a master in computer sciences, started my career as a back-end developer, have held various position as tester, quality leader, project leader, mentor, always keeping hands on code. I switched to front-end technologies years ago and now I am focused full-time on what I love doing: building great software.

Some things I look for in the things I work on:

- bring maximum value to the end user
- maximise empathy and mutual understanding
- robustness and stability
- have great design and experience
- minimize efforts by automating everything I can

## Recent projects

**[Edge-Factory](https://www.edge-factory.com/)** : I worked as a contractor for Edge-Factory, a startup that aims to provide an analytical and management tool for leaders of mid-size companies.

## Random stuff I enjoy

**A good chat**: There's nothing like an interesting chat over a fresh beer (maybe a couple), talking about startup, programming, cooking, cats, anything really. If you're in town and want to meet up, be sure to holler!

**Cooking**: Don't ask me why, but I love to cook. I try new recipes as much as I can, taking note on what failed and what can be done the next time to improve the recipe.

**Sport**: Just any, as long as I'm exhausted after practicing it.
